Game mode server - Cops vs crooks 

Basic idea
This is a game mode that encourages team work, players will have to work together to achieve the goal of the team that they are on. Sometimes players like to work alone to achieve the objective/goal but in cases such as this working as a team gives you better chance of winning, working as a team is more fun than alone right?
This is a highly team based server, we have chats for both teams /C for cops and /B for robbers.

This server is in early development but is constantly getting updated and bugs fixed asap. Currently we are working on fixing the bugs we have found and updating the uis for a cleaner more polished look. We are also working on more features and a more in depth ranking/unlocking system

Cops
The cops task is to stop the crooks boss/leader from getting to the getaway location by killing them or stopping them reaching the location before the time runs out. Ramming and just shooting may not always be the best way to do this, roadblocks and strategically placed team mates to ambush the robbers could work better as shooting out of vehicles is disabled.

Robbers
The robbers task is to support their player boss get to the getaway location safely and before time runs out, they can also use some of the tactics that cops use such as roadblocks and strategically placed players.

Boss
The bosses goal is to get the the getaway location before the time runs out or they run out of life's,the best chance of this is for everyone to work together and be in the middle of your fellow criminals.
